To-do list for ashcomm.py:

1.  Add more error checking and validation
the problem is I don't know
where that's needed.

2.  Decode additional message types and generate more RINEX file types.

3.  Make the GPS-week detection code more robust(relying on the DAL
                                                 sentence isn't the best approach).

4.  Support more receiver commands, like setting elevation mask.

5.  Support file download and management.  The Z12 and micro-Z have
different filesystems so this will take a bit of work.  The "ashfile.py"
file contains the work I've done on it so far.  It previously was able
to download files from a Z12 but with all the changes I've made to the
supporting code, the download function(via xmodem!) doesn't currently
work.  Next step is to fix that.

6.  In connection with that, Ashtech/Magellan published a program written
in Perl called "remote33" that included a C++ program called "convert"
that would read receiver output files and convert them to a format that
could then be converted to RINEX by the "teqc" software.  That is an
awfully clunky process, so I want to combine everything into one program
As a baby step, I've updated the "convert" program to compile on a modern
Linux system, and also fix the GPS week rollover problem.  After I have
a chance to test it, I will add "convert" to this repo for what it might
be worth.
