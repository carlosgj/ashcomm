To-do list for ashcomm.py:

1.  Add more error checking and validation; the problem is I don't know
where that's needed.

2.  Test with Ashtech micro-Z reference station and make any additions
required to support that radio.

3.  Decode additional message types and generate more RINEX file types.

4.  Make the GPS-week detection code more robust (relying on the DAL
sentence isn't the best approach).
